Revision history for Perl extension OOP.

Version 1.0
-----------
The first release of the OOP module handles properties that are passed
to the constructor of any module.  It permits a developer to define
various rules these properties have to follow in order for the custom
module to function.  Thus, if a developer distributes a module he or she
can now rest easy that the intended parameters are passed along with
proper values before the modules can be used.

No other functionality is added as this release serves more of a
foundation for things to come.  I'm taking baby steps here.  Suggestions
are welcome!
