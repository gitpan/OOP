Revision history for Perl extension OOP.

Version 1.01
------------
This version fixes two serious bugs that made it a little difficult to
work with OOP.

One of the fixes covers the addition of exists() support for data
structures used as parameters. Until now it was not possible to check
whether or not an element existed in a hash. This fixes it.

The second bug relates to the writeAccess property in a hash context.
Until now the writeAccess property would be effective only to the 
elements created (in which case anything was possible).  Now it 
properly checks the parent structure to see what properties to take on.

Version 1.00
------------
The first release of the OOP module handles properties that are passed
to the constructor of any module.  It permits a developer to define
various rules these properties have to follow in order for the custom
module to function.  Thus, if a developer distributes a module he or she
can now rest easy that the intended parameters are passed along with
proper values before the modules can be used.

No other functionality is added as this release serves more of a
foundation for things to come.  I'm taking baby steps here.  Suggestions
are welcome!
