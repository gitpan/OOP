OOP version 1.01
================

This class is intended to complement Object Oriented Programming ("OOP")
development by offering solutions to common problems in the OOP world. If 
not problems then this class will also attempt to facilitate various OOP
related tasks and ensure that various conventions are followed, where 
possible. It provides a developer with various methods that enforce 
uniform OOP conventions and ensure sound OOP development in PERL.

Simply stated, this class attempts to take out as much of the OOP overhead 
for the developer as possible while at the same time allowing a developer 
to write more robust applications.

This module presently covers a limited area in Object Oriented Programming.
More bells and wistles will be added as needed. This release serves more of 
a foundation for things to come.  I'm taking baby steps here.  Suggestions
are welcome!
