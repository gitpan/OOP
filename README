OOP version 1.00
================

This class is intended to complement Object Oriented Programming ("OOP")
development by offering solutions to common problems in the OOP world. If 
not problems then this class will also attempt to facilitate various OOP
related tasks and ensure that various conventions are followed, where 
possible. It provides a developer with various methods that enforce 
uniform OOP conventions and ensure sound OOP development in PERL.

Simply stated, this class attempts to take out as much of the OOP overhead 
for the developer as possible while at the same time allowing a developer 
to write more robust applications.

Version 1.0
-----------
The first release of the OOP module handles properties that are passed
to the constructor of any module.  It permits a developer to define 
various rules these properties have to follow in order for the custom
module to function.  Thus, if a developer distributes a module he or she
can now rest easy that the intended parameters are passed along with 
proper values before the modules can be used.

No other functionality is added as this release serves more of a 
foundation for things to come.  I'm taking baby steps here.  Suggestions
are welcome!

See the file Changes for a history of all changes.
